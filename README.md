## Helemt-detection-hackathon
A project under Machine Learning Hackathon to detect persons wearing helmets. This pre-trained network is able to detect helmets from Video/Images, by using the YOLOv3 neural network.

There are already existing models available, mainly for MobileNetSSD networks.
### Reference:
Pre-trained weights are collected from [cansik](https://github.com/cansik/yolo-hand-detection)
